# North Star Conference App - 2019

## Design Questions

- Feedback
    - Should we have a starting page for them to select a session and then push them to the form page?
    - Or should they select the session at the top of the form page?
    - When they have successfully submitted their feedback, how do we let them know it worked?
- Should we have a search feature to search through the sessions?
    - On the Sessions, and Feedback pages
- Should we add other events to the schedule?
    - Thursday night activity
    - Sunday morning testimony meeting
- Map
    - I still need the map
- Need designs for the following pages:
    - Schedule
    - Session Details
    - Speaker Details
    - Sessions
    - Feedback
- Notifications
    - JJ is working on getting notifications working
    - I am not sure how the page functions or what information needs to be displayed
    - However, we may be able to make a design for the page without that information

## Screenshots

Obviously these are not designed/styled yet. I just built them to get the information to display in the correct format. When I have designs for each page, I'll style them after the design.
